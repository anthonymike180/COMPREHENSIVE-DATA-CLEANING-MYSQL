# COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a raw dataset for accurate analysis and reporting. The original dataset contained common data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, duplicate records, and incorrect data types.

The goal of this project was to transform the dataset into a reliable and analysis-ready format by applying systematic data cleaning techniques. The cleaned version of the dataset can now be used confidently for further exploration, visualization, and decision-making.

## Dataset description
The dataset used in this project is a dummy dataset sourced from Kaggle, commonly used for practice and demonstration purposes. It contains synthetic records designed to resemble real-world data, making it suitable for showcasing data cleaning techniques without exposing sensitive information.
