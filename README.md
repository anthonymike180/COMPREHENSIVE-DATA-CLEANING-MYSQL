# COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a raw dataset for accurate analysis and reporting. The original dataset contained common data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, duplicate records, and incorrect data types.

The goal of this project was to transform the dataset into a reliable and analysis-ready format by applying systematic data cleaning techniques. The cleaned version of the dataset can now be used confidently for further exploration, visualization, and decision-making.

## Dataset description
The dataset used in this project is a dummy dataset sourced from Kaggle, commonly used for practice and demonstration purposes. It contains synthetic records designed to resemble real-world data, making it suitable for showcasing data cleaning techniques without exposing sensitive information.

## Tools Used
MySQL & Excel 

## Project Files
- <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL/blob/main/Messy_Employee_Table.csv">Dataset</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL/blob/main/cleaned_employee_table.sql">Complete Mysql code</a>

## Results
The data cleaning process successfully transformed the messy input into a structured and analysis ready dataset. Some key improvements include:
- Removed duplicate employee records to ensure data consistency
- Handled missing values in critical fields 
- Standardized formatting across columns 
- Corrected data types for numeric and date fields
- Created a clean and reliable table ready for analysis or reporting

This cleaned dataset can now be confidently used for further tasks such as:

- Employee performance or salary analysis
- HR reporting and dashboarding
- Feeding into analytical or machine learning workflows

## How to Use

Follow the steps below to reproduce or modify the cleaning process:
- Clone this repository
- Import the raw dataset <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL/blob/main/Messy_Employee_Table.csv">Dataset</a> into MySQL
- You can use tools like MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or the command line.
- Run the SQL cleaning script
- Open <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL/blob/main/cleaned_employee_table.sql">Complete Mysql code</a> and execute the queries step by steps to clean the data.
- This will generate a cleaned version of the dataset as a new table <a href="https://github.com/anthonymike180/COMPREHENSIVE-DATA-CLEANING-MYSQL/blob/main/derived_table.csv">Derived table</a>
